# 🔊 NoiseImpact

**NoiseImpact** is a real-time data engineering project that explores the relationship between environmental noise levels and urban life, starting with data from Dublin, Ireland.

This project pulls live noise pollution data from public Sonitus monitoring stations across Dublin and processes it using a stream processing pipeline. It’s designed to support analysis, visualization, and future correlation with property values, health metrics, or urban planning decisions.
